NAT(Network Address Translation)
--------------------------------
Keep a map(translation) to convert private address and public address on the router.
The receiving host will only see the public IP address,
providing an additional layer of security by concealing the entire internal network behind that address.

For example,
- my public ip

![myPublicIP](https://github.com/Youcheng/LinuxBasics/blob/master/pictures/myPublicIP.png)


- my private ip

![myPrivateIP](https://github.com/Youcheng/LinuxBasics/blob/master/pictures/myPrivateIP.png)

Special and Private IP Address
------------------------------
Special and Private addresses are unregistered and cannot be routed.
